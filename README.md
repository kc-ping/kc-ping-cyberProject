## ðŸ§­ Overview

Welcome to **KC-Ping CyberProject**, a living portfolio that tracks my growth from a beginner to a professional in **Cybersecurity & Data Science**.

This repository contains every key project I build along my journey â€” from early network tools to advanced machine learningâ€“driven threat detection systems.

My goal is to become not only a skilled technical expert but also a **strategic cybersecurity consultant** who can bridge **technology, psychology, and business**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision & Mission

- **Vision:**  
  To create a safer, data-driven, and human-centered digital world.

- **Mission:**  
  Learn, build, and share practical cybersecurity tools that protect people, organizations, and data.  
  I focus equally on **technical mastery**, **data intelligence**, and **human awareness**.
